 * The waste of time in spelling imaginary sounds and their history
 * (or etymology as it is called) is monstrous in English . . .
 * â€”George Bernard Shaw, 1941
 * In the early part of the 20 th century, there was considerable interest in both
 * England and the United States in simplifying the rules used for spelling
 * English words, which has always been a difficult proposition. One suggestion
 * advanced as part of this movement was to eliminate all doubled letters, so that
 * bookkeeper would be written as bokeper and committee would become comite.
 * Write a function removeDoubledLetters(str) that returns a new string in
 * which any duplicated characters in str have been replaced by a single copy.
