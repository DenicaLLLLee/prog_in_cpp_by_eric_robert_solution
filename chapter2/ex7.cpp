 * ------------------------
 * Even though clients of the <cmath> library typically donâ€™t need to understand
 * how functions like sqrt work internally, the implementers of that library have
 * to be able to design an effective algorithm and write the necessary code. If you
 * were asked to implement the sqrt function without using the library version,
 * there are many strategies you could adopt. One of the easiest strategies to
 * understand is successive approximation in which you make a guess at the
 * solution and then refine that guess by choosing new values that move closer to
 * the solution.
 * You can use successive approximation to determine the square root of x by
 * adopting the following strategy:
 * 1. Begin by guessing that the square root is x / 2. Call that guess g.
 * 2. The actual square root must lie between g and x / g. At each step in the
 * successive approximation, generate a new guess by averaging g and x / g.
 * 3. Repeat step 2 until the values g and x / g are as close together as the
 * machine precision allows. In C++, the best way to check for this condition
 * is to test whether the average is equal to either of the values used to
 * generate it.
 * Use this strategy to write your own implementation of the sqrt function.
