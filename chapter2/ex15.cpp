 *  Write a program that simulates flipping a coin repeatedly and continues until
 *  three consecutive heads are tossed. At that point, your program should display
 *  the total number of coin flips that were made. The following is one possible
 *  sample run of the program:
 *  heads
 *  tails
 *  heads
 *  tails
 *  tails
 *  heads
 *  heads
 *  heads
 *  It took 8 flips to get 3 consecutive heads.
